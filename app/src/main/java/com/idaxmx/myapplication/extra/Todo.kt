/**
 * TODO
 * navigate from mainActivity to secondaryActivity but the secondaryActivity will display all user's data selected
 * create a view for activity_secondary with the user data (be creative, so add more attributes to user object)
 * for the future, User data will have at least photo: String (think about it, because the secondaryActivity will need more information about the user)
 * improve activity_main ui
 * add new user return it at the mainActivity (update the list). Note: there is not data persistence, so the user will disappear if the app is killed
